snippet: Explain what I write on this blog.

Laststance.io was originally a place to put repositories that I wanted to publish as a product because it was difficult to organize the primary repository list of my personal account.  

Currently, there is only one package that [eslint-config-ts-prefixer](https://github.com/laststance/eslint-config-ts-prefixer) has been released, but I would like to write about releases of new products and notional changes of existing products in the future.
